            <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>I am a writer, scholar, and website developer currently based in 
                    Brooklyn, New York. I am currently working on an academic paper 
                    entitled Aesthetics of Queer Asian American Motherhoods, a poetry 
                    collection centered on teenage solitude, and several zines dedicated 
                    to urban artistry. 
                <p>        On this page, you will find a portfolio of my work, ranging
                    from creative writing to website development. My focus is largely
                    on portfolio websites such as this one and editorial projects, but
                    I am always eager to take on new challenges!</p>
                <p>Feel free to take a look around and reach out with questions and
                    inquiries! I’m always looking to take on new projects, grow my
                    creative community, and support other artists!</p>
