        <h3>Specializations and Interests</h3>
            <p>My creative work utilizes multimedia expression, drawing
                inspiration from visual art installations, literary criticism,
                and print cultures. Immersed in aesthetic theories, gender
                expression, and identity formation, I deal largely in lyrical
                prose that grapples with topics of queerness, solitude, and
                the political self. Currently, I am heavily inspired by
                Sianne Ngai's <cite>Theory of the Gimmick</cite> and Ju Yon
                Kim's <cite>The Racial Mundane</cite>.</p>
        <h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><cite>whitespace</cite> is a text-only piece of print
                    work distributed in limited quanities across urban arts
                    campuses. This zine is produced in collaboration with Ark
                    Lu, a graphic design student at the Pratt Institute. We
                    feature short form text based content centered on politics
                    of creativity and inspiration in contemporary youth culture
                    with some visual art featured on our Instagram page.</li>
                <li><cite>RELIC</cite> is a photography focused found object
                    publication made in collaboration with an expansive network
                    of photographers and thinkers investigating the
                    meaning-making processes at work in the relationships
                    between artists, their work, and their audiences. This is
                    an online publication with limited print copies distributed
                    as found object pieces in various U.S. locations.</li>
